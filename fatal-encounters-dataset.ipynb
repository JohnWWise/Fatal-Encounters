Marshall, 18, and Jacquez Barber, 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            4\nFour people in two vehicles died in the collision of a grey Chevrolet Monte Carlo, driven by Stacy Garcia Gray, and a red sedan being chased by police, containing Shawnice Osborne, Larry Gilmore, and an unidentified third person. For two miles the sedan had fled officers after a shots-fired call and an attempted traffic stop. The crash and resulting fire was so intense that the make and model of the sedan was unclear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                4\nAt 11:38 p.m., two motorcycle officers attempted to stop two cars traveling 75 mph on Blackstone near Barstow. One of the drivers pulled his Camaro over, but the driver of a black Mustang, Irvin Villarreal,18, did not stop. A pursuing officer turned on his lights and siren, but reportedly was delayed from turning immediately onto Bullard when the traffic signal turned red. The officer reportedly lost the suspect vehicle. The officer drove until he reached N Maroa Ave before ending the pursuit. Reportedly, two and a half minutes later, a 9-1-1 call came into dispatch reporting a three-car collision at Bullard and Palm. When officers arrived, three passengers, 27-year-old Christopher Vang and cousins Linda Chang, 21, and Allison Chang, 17, inside a pickup truck hit by the Mustang were dead. Two other passengers in the pickup truck are hospitalized, with one in critical condition. A Mini Cooper driven by a 17-year-old girl was also hit, and she was injured. The driver of the Mustang, Villarreal, was killed. N Maroa Ave and W Bullard Ave is less than 800 yards from N Palm Ave & W Bullard Ave.    4\nManuel Rendon-Lucas, 17, was allegedly fleeing a police stop for speeding, killing five unidentified people upon crashing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           4\nArvin police were chasing a BMW when they reportedly lost track of the car and called off the pursuit. Around 1 a.m., CHP officers found a car engulfed in flames that had crashed into a dirt embankment. Arvin police confirmed it was the same BMW from the pursuit. All four people in the car were killed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4\nMore than five calls about shots fired on the near south side at 2:30 a.m. developed into police spotting a dark-colored Nissan Maxima, apparently with somebody handling a rifle in the back seat. Police gave chase. The pursued Maxima went out of control, smashed into the median and a light pole. Dead were Lamont Cross, Gregory Franklin, and Dasha Rhodes. A fourth occupant emerged in critical but stable condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     3\nA 2017 Dodge Charger was southbound on U.S. 29 attempting to elude police when it struck a 2007 Jeep Commander that was pulling out of a private driveway onto the highway. Both vehicles caught fire from the impact. Charles Rickman Stepp, 61, and Kenneth James Heavner, 25, were killed. Chavis Diggs, 37, died May 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3\nIssac Parker's sport utility vehicle was pulled over for a faulty headlight. Officer Kenneth Agee and his partner, Officer Jared Domaracki, suspected Parker was intoxicated. As Domaracki reached in through the driver's side window to turn off the ignition, and Agee did the same thing from the passenger's side, Parker hit the accelerator and took off down Fillmore. Agee shot Parker once in the right side. Parker continued on Fillmore before crashing into three street light poles, one of which fell on Ida Murphy, killing her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3\nOff duty police killed 1-year-old child, boyfriend and self.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3\nPolice were slow to reveal the reason why plainclothes officers in an unmarked car chose to pursue Devell Johns and Terrell Young in their Honda Accord. At high speed the Accord slammed into a Jeep with Angel Chiwengo as passenger causing a fiery collision. The driver of the Jeep was seriously injured. Johns, Young and Chiwengo were killed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               3\nAt 1 a.m. Pedro A. Garciga in a stolen Cadillac Escalade was being chased by multiple jurisdictions.

We recommend comma-separated values.         NaN Column A, Fatal Encounters' Unique ID: Generally speaking, the UID works like other UIDs work; new IDs are added to new incidents without consideration of the date of the incident or the date of its inclusion into the dataset. However, twice since 2012, we've had to rebuild UIDs because of problems with the Google Spreadsheet. This in no way infers a problem with the sheet, more likely operator error, but in one instance, formulas crept in, and in the other, UIDs, which are generated manually, developed duplicate values. Also, if a duplicate record is discovered in the data, the duplicate is replaced with a non-duplicate, in order to keep the UIDs sequential, and to enable visual verification that the UIDs are working as intended. Column A is manually replicated in Column AA as a backup to enable replacement of Column A, if problems with the UIDs ever arise again. Fatal Encounters recommends researchers note download dates. The current sheet always includes the most up-to-date data and accurate data.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKmaV_JiWcG8XBoRgP8b4e9Eopkpgt7FL7nyspvzAsE/edit#gid=0         NaN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Column B, Subject's name: Names contain all information Fatal Encounters has been able to collect, including nicknames if available. Often additional information for names comes through obituaries or social media. In case of \"Names withheld by police,\" the names are sometimes also voluntarily withheld by news media--especially in the cases of suicide--but police fail to publish the names through public disclosures. In the cases of \"aka,\" sometimes this indicates errors or variations of names reported in news media, and sometimes it indicates aliases used by the decedent. In instances of transgender individuals, it's a regretable necessity because news media and police often refuse to identify transgender people by their chosen names and gender.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Fatal Encounters documents non-police deaths that occur when police are present or are precipitated by police action or presence. Officer deaths are included when caused by another officer, including friendly fire incidents, and criminal actions—like domestic violence—and suicides that occur when other officers are present. Officer vehicle-related deaths are included when they are caused by another officer. Homicides of officers by felons or deaths in the regular course of duties are not generally documented in the database.

Ages frequently change with updates in articles, with early reporting being the least accurate, neither police nor news media using \"time between date\" calculators, instead subtracting birth year from current year. In cases where police and media reports and obituaries conflict, and there is no birth date available, Fatal Encounters generally goes with the age stated in the obituary.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        We believe we include all the available records for all 50 states and DC back to 2000, but there are several data points that we think are too poorly reported in the news media to result in accurate results for analysis: disposition and mental state. Our racial data (Column D) is the best that exists, but it's pretty spotty and gets worse prior to 2013. Beginning in 2020 we added two columns that regard imputed race. We generally do weekly updates on Tuesdays (although for practical reasons, sometimes that's extended later into the week), so be aware we're usually a few days behind. Government data also suggests that police chase deaths are often not reported in news media, so our data almost certainly understates those totals.

Visual evidence includes images in news stories, obituaries, or body camera  or other surveilance videos. Sometimes race is disclosed in a news article as an identifying characteristic of who was killed, particularly when police are withholding a name. Occasionally, FE researchers will contact a family to determine the race.

The vast majority of these records come from media sources and police records. That means only one version of the story—the police story—is generally told in the descriptions. Rarely do news media seek out family members and friends to balance or contradict police narratives. While we verify our data against media reports, sometimes the information presented is so wildly inaccurate that we instead include accurate but conflicting information. Also, be aware that this document is \"living.\" We repair any errors or eliminate any duplicates as we discover them. Errors can be reported through the fatalencounters.org website. We also sometimes discover new incidents in older time periods. Researchers who use the data should note when they download the spreadsheet so they can note changes in newer documents. We don't own many of the photos on the spreadsheet or displayed on the website, and they are not always explicitly authorized by the copyright owner. While we're using the images under \"Fair Use\" doctrine, for-profit news outlets should probably obtain permission from the copyright owner. That being said, taxpayer-funded images, like mugshots, aren't owned by the police agency that took them or any news agency that happens to display them.

Carla DeCeros' volunteer work was amazing. She did the initial work on more than 20 percent of this data. Walt Lockley also did incredible work, completing research on several key states. Christopher Cox did the bulk of the work on Texas. I can't begin to mention all the people who contributed, but those three moved the data collection ahead by years. We've also had two funders who came forward when we desperately needed help.  Jan Schaffer, executive director of J-Lab: The Institute for Interactive Journalism enabled us to move from a primarily crowdsourced, volunteer project to a more professional effort with a $12,000 grant. Our largest individual funder has been Jeff Moe, and his contributions have meant the difference between moving forward and shuttering the project.

While the numbers have been relatively small, we have found errors in imputed races.\nOur racial imputations were added on January 17, 2020, and will be updated periodically.\\nThe imputations were calculated by Joseph Gibbons, PhD\\nAssociate Professor \\nDepartment of Sociology\\nAssociate Director Center for Human Dynamics in our Mobile Age (HDMA)\\nSan Diego State University\\n\\nFor most entries without a reported race/ethnicity, race/ethnicity was imputed with estimates derived with Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG).  This method uses both surnames and demographics of place of residence of victims to estimate their race/ethnicity (Elliott et al. 2008).  This method has been demonstrated in other fields, including mortgage research, to be a useful method to determine race/ethnicity (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 2014).  Our estimates were validated by singling out encounters where one's race was determined and comparing the estimated values to the reported values.  As reported below, we found the correlation of estimates to reported values to be moderate to strong and in all cases statistically significant.  In the dataset (Columns F and G), we report the probabilities for each imputed race/ethnicity.\\n\\nCorrelations Between Imputed Race/Ethnicity and Reported Race/Ethnicity\\nWhite, 0.61;        Black, 0.64;        Hispanic, 0.82;        Asian, 0.68;        Native American, 0.46\\n\\nCitations\\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. 2014. “Using Publicly Available Information to Proxy for Unidentified Race and Ethnicity.” Washington, D.C.: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\\nElliott, MarcN, Allen Fremont, PeterA Morrison, Philip Pantoja, and Nicole Lurie. 2008. “A New Method for Estimating Race/Ethnicity and Associated Disparities Where Administrative Records Lack Self-Reported Race/Ethnicity.” Health Services Research 43 (5 Pt 1): 1722–36. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2008.00854.x.

The idea is to provide a means for our researchers to easily remove incidents that are not typically considered intentional use of force. The convention will have results following a backslash, including /off-duty or /collaterol death, officer present and others. Again, we suggest that outside researchers do not use the column for analysis because its contents are in development.

\"Highest level of force\" on February 8, 2021.

On February 17, 2021, we finished the first part of the integration. It is very important to let us know if you spot any errors by emailing d.brian@fatalencounters.org. Reporting errors is the only requirement to use the data. Errors may be spotted by comparing the data in the threat-assessment columns to the descriptions. We began with January 2014 through June 2020, and we expect to a) Remain 6 months from current and b) Continue to backfill by year in reverse order: 2013, 2012, 2011, until the data gets too poor to continue.\n

Column AA, Intentional Use of Force (Developing) Codes will be Less-than-lethal force; No; Deadly force; Suicide, Vehicle, Pursuit, Vehic/Purs. At the onset of development, our plan is to further define Vehic/Purs. Deadly force will indicate an intentional use of force with the vehicle, for example, when an officer intentionally runs down an alleged criminal.  Less-than-lethal is when an officer uses a PIT maneuver or spike strips. Vehicle will indicate an accident, for example, an officer hits a pedestrian or another vehicle when not engaged in a pursuit. Pursuit will indicate whether the officer was or had been in pursuit.\n

Officer deaths are included when caused by another officer, including friendly fire incidents, and criminal actions—like domestic violence—and suicides that occur when other officers are present. Officer vehicle-related deaths are included when they are caused by another officer. Homicides of officers by felons or deaths in the regular course of duties are not generally documented in the database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\nWe believe we include all the available records for all 50 states and DC back to 2000, but there are several data points that we think are too poorly reported in the news media to result in accurate results for analysis: disposition and mental state. Our racial data (Column D) is the best that exists, but it's pretty spotty and gets worse prior to 2013. Beginning in 2020 we added two columns that regard imputed race. We generally do weekly updates on Tuesdays (although for practical reasons, sometimes that's extended later into the week), so be aware we're usually a few days behind. Government data also suggests that police chase deaths are often not reported in news media, so our data almost certainly understates those totals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\nThis data is available for anyone to use for whatever purpose they choose. The only requirement for use is if users spot any errors, please report it to d.brian@fatalencounters.org. As of October 2020, we require attribution, as some users are using the data in unethical ways, for example, we don't track mental illness, we track whether the officer knew the person was in mental crisis before they arrived. Misusing the data would result in wildly inaccurate underestimates of the impact of mental illness and drug or alcohol use on these deaths. We're FatalEncounters.org. If you have questions, just email d.brian@fatalencounters.org.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\nSome words of caution. The vast majority of these records come from media sources and police records. That means only one version of the story—the police story—is generally told in the descriptions. Rarely do news media seek out family members and friends to balance or contradict police narratives. While we verify our data against media reports, sometimes the information presented is so wildly inaccurate that we instead include accurate but conflicting information. Also, be aware that this document is \"living.\" We repair any errors or eliminate any duplicates as we discover them. Errors can be reported through the fatalencounters.org website. We also sometimes discover new incidents in older time periods. Researchers who use the data should note when they download the spreadsheet so they can note changes in newer documents. We don't own many of the photos on the spreadsheet or displayed on the website, and they are not always explicitly authorized by the copyright owner. While we're using the images under \"Fair Use\" doctrine, for-profit news outlets should probably obtain permission from the copyright owner. That being said, taxpayer-funded images, like mugshots, aren't owned by the police agency that took them or any news agency that happens to display them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\nThis project owes a great debt to the many volunteers and paid researchers who got us this far. Carla DeCeros' volunteer work was amazing. She did the initial work on more than 20 percent of this data. Walt Lockley also did incredible work, completing research on several key states. Christopher Cox did the bulk of the work on Texas. I can't begin to mention all the people who contributed, but those three moved the data collection ahead by years. We've also had two funders who came forward when we desperately needed help.  Jan Schaffer, executive director of J-Lab: The Institute for Interactive Journalism enabled us to move from a primarily crowdsourced, volunteer project to a more professional effort with a $12,000 grant. Our largest individual funder has been Jeff Moe, and his contributions have meant the difference between moving forward and shuttering the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\nOur racial imputations were added on January 17, 2020, and will be updated periodically.\\nThe imputations were calculated by Joseph Gibbons, PhD\\nAssociate Professor \\nDepartment of Sociology\\nAssociate Director Center for Human Dynamics in our Mobile Age (HDMA)\\nSan Diego State University\\n\\nFor most entries without a reported race/ethnicity, race/ethnicity was imputed with estimates derived with Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG).  This method uses both surnames and demographics of place of residence of victims to estimate their race/ethnicity (Elliott et al. 2008).  This method has been demonstrated in other fields, including mortgage research, to be a useful method to determine race/ethnicity (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 2014).  Our estimates were validated by singling out encounters where one's race was determined and comparing the estimated values to the reported values.  As reported below, we found the correlation of estimates to reported values to be moderate to strong and in all cases statistically significant.  In the dataset (Columns F and G), we report the probabilities for each imputed race/ethnicity.\\n\\nCorrelations Between Imputed Race/Ethnicity and Reported Race/Ethnicity\\nWhite, 0.61;        Black, 0.64;        Hispanic, 0.82;        Asian, 0.68;        Native American, 0.46\\n\\nCitations\\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. 2014. “Using Publicly Available Information to Proxy for Unidentified Race and Ethnicity.” Washington, D.C.: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\\nElliott, MarcN, Allen Fremont, PeterA Morrison, Philip Pantoja, and Nicole Lurie. 2008. “A New Method for Estimating Race/Ethnicity and Associated Disparities Where Administrative Records Lack Self-Reported Race/Ethnicity.” Health Services Research 43 (5 Pt 1): 1722–36. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2008.00854.x.    1\nThe racial imputations work was funded by USC and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD R01HD093382                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\nAlso beginning in January 2020, we have begun adding \"exclusions\" to the \"Dispositions\" column with the intention of backfilling when time is available. The idea is to provide a means for our researchers to easily remove incidents that are not typically considered intentional use of force. The convention will have results following a backslash, including /off-duty or /collaterol death, officer present and others. Again, we suggest that outside researchers do not use the column for analysis because its contents are in development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\"Codebook\" in development:\n\"Codebook\" in development\nColumn A, Fatal Encounters' Unique ID: Generally speaking, the UID works like other UIDs work; new IDs are added to new incidents without consideration of the date of the incident or the date of its inclusion into the dataset. However, twice since 2012, we've had to rebuild UIDs because of problems with the Google Spreadsheet. This in no way infers a problem with the sheet, more likely operator error, but in one instance, formulas crept in, and in the other, UIDs, which are generated manually, developed duplicate values. Also, if a duplicate record is discovered in the data, the duplicate is replaced with a non-duplicate, in order to keep the UIDs sequential, and to enable visual verification that the UIDs are working as intended. Column A is manually replicated in Column AA as a backup to enable replacement of Column A, if problems with the UIDs ever arise again. Fatal Encounters recommends researchers note download dates. The current sheet always includes the most up-to-date data and accurate data.    1\nColumn Y,  A brief description of the circumstances surrounding the death:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\nColumn S, ORI7s: In development, to be added at a later date                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\nColumn T, Cause of death: Changed column header to \"Highest level of force\" on February 8, 2021. This column was never intended to represent the \"official\" cause of death, and it has been polluted with \"official\" attempts to manufacture justifiability, like \"excited delirium\" and diseases that only became deadly when police force was applied. We'll eliminate many \"medical emergencies\" and \"drug overdoses\" that only became deadly when police force was applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\nColumn U, Armed or Unarmed: Beginning Jan. 30, 2021 Fatal Encounters began adding four new columns regarding \"threat assessments\" Armed/Unarmed, Alleged weapon, Aggressive physical movement, Fleeing/Not fleeing. On February 17, 2021, we finished the first part of the integration. It is very important to let us know if you spot any errors by emailing d.brian@fatalencounters.org. Reporting errors is the only requirement to use the data. Errors may be spotted by comparing the data in the threat-assessment columns to the descriptions. We began with January 2014 through June 2020, and we expect to a) Remain 6 months from current and b) Continue to backfill by year in reverse order: 2013, 2012, 2011, until the data gets too poor to continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\nColumn V, Alleged weapon: Beginning Jan. 30, 2021 Fatal Encounters began adding four new columns regarding \"threat assessments\" Armed/Unarmed, Alleged weapon, Aggressive physical movement, Fleeing/Not fleeing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\nColumn W, Physical movement: Beginning Jan. 30, 2021 Fatal Encounters began adding four new columns regarding \"threat assessments\" Armed/Unarmed, Alleged weapon, Aggressive physical movement, Fleeing/Not fleeing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\nColumn X, Fleeing/Not fleeing: Beginning Jan. 30, 2021 Fatal Encounters began adding four new columns regarding \"threat assessments\" Armed/Unarmed, Alleged weapon, Aggressive physical movement, Fleeing/Not fleeing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\nColumn Z,  Dispositions/Exclusions INTERNAL USE, NOT FOR ANALYSIS:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\nColumn B, Subject's name: Names contain all information Fatal Encounters has been able to collect, including nicknames if available. Often additional information for names comes through obituaries or social media. In case of \"Names withheld by police,\" the names are sometimes also voluntarily withheld by news media--especially in the cases of suicide--but police fail to publish the names through public disclosures. In the cases of \"aka,\" sometimes this indicates errors or variations of names reported in news media, and sometimes it indicates aliases used by the decedent. In instances of transgender individuals, it's a regretable necessity because news media and police often refuse to identify transgender people by their chosen names and gender.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\nCurrently Column V. Column AA, Intentional Use of Force (Developing) Codes will be Less-than-lethal force; No; Deadly force; Suicide, Vehicle, Pursuit, Vehic/Purs. At the onset of development, our plan is to further define Vehic/Purs. Deadly force will indicate an intentional use of force with the vehicle, for example, when an officer intentionally runs down an alleged criminal.  Less-than-lethal is when an officer uses a PIT maneuver or spike strips. Vehicle will indicate an accident, for example, an officer hits a pedestrian or another vehicle when not engaged in a pursuit. Pursuit will indicate whether the officer was or had been in pursuit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\nColumn AB, Link to news article or photo of official document:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\nColumn AC, Were police aware of symptoms of mental illness before interaction?

Let's assess its suitability for your investigation and state-by-state mapping project.\n\n## Dataset Structure\n\nThe Excel file contains five sheets:\n\n1. **Form Responses**: Primary data sheet with over 31,000 entries of fatal encounters.\n2. **State Abbreviations and Population**: Contains state abbreviations and population data.\n3. **ReadMe**: Provides important notes, explanations, and caveats.\n4. **Threat Assessment Methodology**: Outlines methodology for threat assessment columns added in 2021.\n5. **Threat Assessment Conventions**: Contains specific guidelines for the threat assessment process.\n\n## Key Data Points\n\nThe Form Responses sheet includes several columns crucial for your investigation:\n\n| Column Name | Non-Null Count | Description |\n|-------------|----------------|-------------|\n| Age | 30277 non-null | Subject's age. May change with updates. Early reporting often least accurate. |\n| Date of injury resulting in death | 31498 non-null | Date when the injury leading to death occurred. |\n| Gender | 31354 non-null | Male, Female, Transgender, or empty cell. |\n| Race with imputations | 30630 non-null | Combines non-imputed and imputed race codes. Added in 2020. |\n| State | 31497 non-null | State where death occurred. Data quality may vary. |\n| Agency or agencies involved | 31420 non-null | Agency(ies) involved in death. |\n| Highest level of force | 31494 non-null | Type of force used. Use with caution due to potential bias. |\n| Armed/Unarmed | 17071 non-null | Added Jan 2021. Not available for older entries. |\n| Alleged weapon | 10952 non-null | Added Jan 2021. Not available for older entries. |\n| Aggressive physical movement | 12651 non-null | Added Jan 2021. May involve subjective interpretation. |\n| Fleeing/Not fleeing | 17078 non-null | Added Jan 2021. Not available for older entries. |\n| Intended use of force (Developing) | 31495 non-null | Codes for different types of force used. Still in development. |\n\n## Data Quality and Coverage\n\n- Over 31,000 entries dating back to 2000.\n- Aims to include all available records for all 50 states and DC since 2000.\n- Data quality and completeness vary across columns and time periods.\n- Geographic data is generally well-documented.\n\n## Recent Additions\n\nIn 2021, four new \"threat assessment\" columns were added:\n- Armed/Unarmed\n- Alleged weapon\n- Aggressive physical movement\n- Fleeing/Not fleeing\n\nThese provide additional context but are only available for more recent entries.\n\n## Suitability for Your Project\n\nThis dataset is well-suited for investigating killings by police:\n- Comprehensive coverage across all states\n- Detailed geographic information for mapping\n- Substantial sample size for meaningful analysis\n- Inclusion of various relevant factors (demographics, agency involvement, type of force used)\n\nFor your state-by-state map, use the geographic data (State column, Latitude, and Longitude) from the Form Responses sheet, combined with state population data from the State Abbreviations and Population sheet. This allows creation of a map showing incident distribution across states, potentially normalized by population.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile this dataset has limitations and potential biases, it provides valuable information for investigating killings by police and creating a state-by-state map of incidents. The geographic data aligns well with your mapping goals. As with any dataset, approach the analysis critically and be aware of potential limitations and biases in the data collection and reporting process.\n\nGiven the rich information available in this dataset, it would be worthwhile to conduct a more thorough investigation of the most relevant data points for your research on police killings. Some key elements that could provide valuable insights into the patterns and trends you're interested in include:\n\n1. Geographic distribution: Analyzing incidents by state and region to identify potential hotspots or disparities.\n2. Temporal trends: Examining how the frequency and nature of incidents have changed over time since 2000.\n3. Demographic patterns: Investigating the age, gender, and racial distribution of individuals involved in fatal encounters.\n4. Agency involvement: Exploring which law enforcement agencies are most frequently involved in these incidents.\n5. Use of force: Analyzing the \"Highest level of force\" and \"Intended use of force\" columns to understand how force is being applied.\n6. Threat assessment: For more recent data, examining the relationship between the \"Armed/Unarmed\" status, \"Alleged weapon\", and outcomes.\n\nTo help you better understand and visualize these key aspects of the data, I can create various types of visual representations. These could include choropleth maps showing the distribution of incidents across states, time series graphs to illustrate trends over the years, charts for demographic breakdowns, and comparative charts to analyze use of force across different agencies or regions.\n\nWould you like me to create any of these visualizations to help you gain deeper insights into police killings across different regions and demographics?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"color: blue; font-size: 1.2em;\">\n\n## **Second Prompt:** \"yeah show me

is based on the Fatal Encounters dataset, which provides comprehensive information on killings by police in the United States from 2000 to 2021. The dataset includes over 31,000 entries and covers all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\n## Data Caveats and Limitations\n\nBefore diving into the analysis, it's crucial to understand some limitations and recent changes to the dataset:\n\n1. **Data Cutoff**: The dataset currently only includes incidents up to 2021. More recent incidents are not captured in this analysis, which may not reflect the most current trends or changes in policing practices.\n\n2. **Population Data**: The population data used for rate calculations is from 2015. This means that any population-adjusted analyses (such as incidents per capita) may not accurately reflect current demographic distributions, especially in areas that have experienced significant population changes since 2015.\n\n3. **Recent Additions**: In January 2021, four new \"threat assessment\" columns were added:\n   - Armed/Unarmed\n   - Alleged weapon\n   - Aggressive physical movement\n   - Fleeing/Not fleeing\n   These columns are only available for more recent entries, primarily from 2014 onwards, and are still being backfilled for earlier years.\n\n4. **Data Quality**: The dataset creators note that some data points, particularly disposition and mental state, are poorly reported in news media and may not result in accurate analysis.\n\n5. **Racial Data**: While this dataset provides the best available racial data, it's acknowledged to be spotty, especially for entries prior to 2013.\n\n6. **Underreporting**: Government data suggests that police chase deaths are often not reported in news media, so the dataset likely understates these totals.\n\n\n## Overview of Police-Involved Killings\n\nThe dataset reveals a concerning trend in police-involved killings over the past two decades. \n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n<iframe src=\"./data/out/time_series.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\nAs shown in the time series graph above, there has been a general upward trend in the number of fatal encounters with police since 2000. Notable spikes occurred in mid-2015 and mid-2020, potentially coinciding with periods of increased social unrest and heightened scrutiny of police actions. It's important to note that this trend only extends to 2021, and more recent data is not included in this analysis.\n\n## Demographic Analysis\n\nThe demographic breakdown of individuals involved in fatal encounters with police reveals significant disparities:\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n<iframe src=\"./data/out/Age_and_Race_Distribution_by_Gender.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\nKey observations:\n- Males, particularly those aged 18-40, are disproportionately represented in fatal encounters.\n- African-American/Black individuals are overrepresented relative to their share of the U.S. population, especially among younger age groups.\n- There is a notable peak in fatalities for males aged 18-30 across all racial categories.\n\nNote: The racial data in this analysis includes both reported and imputed race information. Imputed race data was added in 2020 using Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) for entries without a reported race.\n\n## Geographic Distribution\n\nThe distribution of fatal encounters varies significantly across states:\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n<iframe src=\"./data/out/us_states_choropleth.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\nCalifornia, Texas, and Florida have the highest absolute numbers of fatal encounters. However, when normalizing for population:\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n<iframe src=\"./data/out/us_states_2015_fatal_encounters_choropleth.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\nStates like New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Alaska show higher rates of fatal encounters relative to their population size. It's crucial to note that these population-adjusted rates are based on 2015 population data, which may not accurately reflect current population distributions.\n\n## Use of Force Analysis\n\nThe dataset provides insights into the types of force used in these encounters:\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 900px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n<iframe src=\"./data/out/top_50_by_force.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\nGunshots are by far the most common highest level of force used, followed by vehicle-related incidents. This pattern is consistent across most agencies.\n\n## Armed Status and Weapons\n\nThe armed status of individuals involved in fatal encounters is a critical factor:\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n<iframe src=\"./data/out/armed_weapon.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\nKey findings:\n- A significant portion of individuals were armed, with firearms being the most common weapon.\n- However, a substantial number of unarmed individuals were also involved in fatal encounters.\n- There's a large number of cases where the armed status is unknown, highlighting potential gaps in reporting or transparency.\n\nNote: The \"Armed/Unarmed\" and \"Alleged weapon\" categories were added in 2021 and are not available for all entries, particularly those from earlier years.\n\n## Movement and Fleeing Status\n\nThe dataset also provides information on the behavior of individuals during these encounters:\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n<iframe src=\"./data/out/movement_pie_chart.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\nWhile a large portion of cases lack detailed information, significant numbers of individuals were reported to have brandished or used weapons, or made movements perceived as threatening by officers.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n<iframe src=\"./data/out/fleeing_stacked_force.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\nThis chart shows the relationship between fleeing status and the intended use of force. Notably, deadly force was used in a significant number of cases where individuals were fleeing, raising questions about the proportionality of force used in these situations.\n\nNote: The \"Aggressive physical movement\" and \"Fleeing/Not fleeing\" categories were added in 2021 and are not available for all entries, particularly those from earlier years.\n\n## Final Notes on Data Interpretation\n\nWhen interpreting this data, it's important to remember:\n1. The dataset is primarily based on media reports and may not capture all incidents.\n2. The addition of new data fields in recent years means that some analyses may not be consistent across the entire time period.\n3. Imputed racial data and other estimations are used where direct information is not available.\n4. The dataset is continually updated, which may lead to slight changes in analysis over time.\n5. The most recent data is from 2021, so current trends may differ from those observed in this analysis.\n6. Population-adjusted rates are based on 2015 population data, which may not reflect current demographic distributions.\n\nDespite these limitations, this dataset provides valuable insights into the patterns and trends of fatal encounters with police in the United States from 2000 to 2021. However, for the most up-to-date understanding of current situations, this analysis should be supplemented with more recent data and reports.\n\n## Proposed Continuation of Analysis\n\nGiven the limitations of our current dataset, which only includes data up to 2021, and the significant public discourse around police violence in recent years, a valuable direction for further analysis presents itself. We can leverage our existing historical data to create projections, setting up a framework for future comparisons when more recent data becomes available.\n\nOne potentially insightful approach is to generate department-level projections of police-involved killings for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024 based solely on trends observed in our 2000-2021 data. To ensure a manageable and focused analysis, we will limit our scope to the top 200 departments by the count of police-involved killings. This exercise would serve multiple purposes:\n\n- It would provide a data-driven baseline representing the continuation of historical trends for each department, uninfluenced by recent events or policy changes.\n- When actual data for these years becomes available, these projections would offer a valuable point of comparison, potentially highlighting the impact of recent reform efforts, policy changes, or shifts in public awareness at a local level.\n- It could help identify departments where actual future numbers significantly deviate from projections, prompting further investigation into the causes of such deviations.\n\n## Proposed Methodology and Expected Outputs\n\nI propose using the following method to generate the projections:\n\n1. **Time Series Modeling (ARIMA without Seasonal Component):** This method will use ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) without incorporating seasonal components, as the projections are yearly. This approach is well-suited for identifying long-term trends based on historical data.\n\nThe ARIMA model will provide a set of projections with associated confidence intervals. The results will be presented in a comprehensive table that lists each department, its historical data, and the projections generated by the ARIMA model.\n\n## Aggregated Model Performance Evaluation\n\nGiven that only the ARIMA model was used, the analysis will focus on evaluating its performance across all departments. Metrics such as overall RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error) will be calculated, and the model’s performance will be assessed to ensure it provides reliable projections for all departments.\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\nSeveral challenges must be acknowledged:\n1. **Data Limitations:** The existing dataset may have inconsistencies or gaps, especially for smaller departments.\n2. **Interpretation Caution:** It's crucial to communicate that these are projections based on historical data, not predictions accounting for recent events or changes.\n\nBy leveraging historical data to create department-level projections for 2022-2024, this analysis could provide a valuable tool for understanding and addressing police-involved killings at a local level. The projections will serve as a crucial baseline for future analysis, enabling meaningful comparisons and insights when actual data becomes available. This will help assess the impact of recent reform efforts and identify departments that have successfully deviated from historical trends. Ultimately, this framework could facilitate a more targeted and effective response to this critical issue.\n'''))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-18T21:41:19.661261Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-18T21:41:19.661801Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-18T21:41:19.684300Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-18T21:41:19.661766Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-18T21:41:19.683000Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"\n# Analysis of Police-Involved Killings in the United States\n\nThis analysis is based on the Fatal Encounters dataset, which provides comprehensive information on killings by police in the United States from 2000 to 2021.

These predictions were compared to the actual 2021 data to evaluate the model's performance, yielding the following metrics across all agencies:\n    - **Mean MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** 1.230532\n    - **Mean RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** 1.230532\n    - **Mean sMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error):** 51.039123\n\n   The MAE and RMSE values indicate that the model's predictions were generally close to the actual values, with average errors around 1.23 deaths per agency. The higher sMAPE likely reflects the sensitivity of this metric to small or zero counts, where even minor discrepancies can result in large percentage errors.\n\n2. **Generating Future Projections for 2022-2024:** In the second stage, the model was retrained using data from 2000 to 2021 and used to forecast police-involved killings for 2022, 2023, and 2024. The predictions include confidence intervals to account for uncertainty.\n\n\nThis analysis has produced both a set of evaluated 2021 predictions and forward-looking projections for 2022-2024. The generated metrics and the projections will serve as a crucial baseline for understanding trends and deviations in police-involved killings across departments. The results of this analysis, including detailed projections with confidence intervals, have been saved to a CSV file for further review and application and can be downloaded [here](./data/out/by_agency_predictions.csv).","metadata":{}}]}
